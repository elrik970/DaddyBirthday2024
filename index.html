        Thank you for cooking us food, making us money, taking care of us, playing board games with us, taking us places, playing video games with us, going on vacations with us, teaching us stuff, fixing stuff, cleaning stuff, and everything you do for us.

        <p>Without you this family could not exist</p>
        <p style = "color: #71e8ce;font-weight: bold;">Thanks - Elrik</p>
